V.Collaboration: 

	We don't separate the work for each team member, instead we sat down and did the coding 	
	together, step by step. We went over each fucntion that we used and try to understand 		
	them. We also explain what it does for everyone in our team, make sure everyone will 		
	understand the problems and how all the functions work, understand the purpose of this 		
	assignment.We also used githup to finialize and code for the this project, because we have
	time limited.


V.Special found.

	This project should be given with more time to complete.
